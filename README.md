# FezzedOne-Drawable-Generator

A drawable generator that, among other things, includes support for `bodyDirectives` drawables. Requires Python 3.x and `pillow`. Templates were contributed by @Silverfeelin and Dokie. Code should be self-explanatory, though feel free to suggest improvements.

# TODOs

- [ ] Clean up code.
- [ ] Add the new flexible single-frame drawable method.
